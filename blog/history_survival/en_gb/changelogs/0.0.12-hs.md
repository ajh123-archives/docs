## History Survival 0.0.12-hs release

History Survival was rewritten (again). Now it uses [Voxelscape](https://github.com/lolleko/voxelscape/) as a base. More features will be implemented later. Below is a list of some features.

Find the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/ajh123-development/HistorySurvival/releases/tag/0.0.12-hs)

### Features:

* Distance Field Shadows
* Voxel Ambient Occlusion
* Simple point lights (block emission)
* Basic RTS implemented using ECS
* Voxel rendered using advanced instancing, instead of the more popular greedy meshing
* Custom voxel model editor
* Simple terrain gerenation, with a few different biomes
